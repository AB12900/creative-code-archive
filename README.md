# 🎨 Creative Code Archive

This repository contains a collection of creative coding projects developed as part of my coursework in a **Creative Code** class. 
Each project explores unique themes and techniques using **p5.js**, ranging from generative visuals and sound synthesis to interactive sketches and algorithmic art.

## 💡 About This Collection

Throughout the semester, I built a variety of experiments that showcase different areas of creative coding:

- **Audio-Reactive Art** — visuals that respond to sound and piano input
- **Generative Patterns** — using randomness, loops, and Perlin noise
- **Interactive Experiences** — mouse and keyboard-driven animation
- **Custom Visual Styles** — layering, gradients, and unique aesthetics

Each folder represents a standalone sketch or mini-project, with its own creative concept and code structure.

## 📁 What's Inside

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Piano_keys` | A multi-mode visual piano interface reacting to key input and full audio tracks |
| `Sound_Garden` | Nature-inspired ambient sketch with music interaction |
| `animated_circle`, `canvas_basics`, `perlin_noise_demo`, etc. | Experiments in shape, color, loops, and animation |
| `control_canvas`, `sound_synthesis` | Mouse control and tone generation projects |
| `Project2`, `ProbSet4`, `PS3_objects_vectors` | Coursework and problem set submissions |

## 🧰 Tech Used

- **p5.js** — JavaScript creative coding library
- **p5.sound** — For audio analysis and synthesis
- **Tweakpane** — GUI controls for interactive parameters

## 🚀 How to Use Creative Code Archive

This repository is a collection of creative coding projects made for my creative coding class. 
Each folder showcases a different idea, experiment, or visual concept brought to life through p5.js.

These projects explore sound, motion, interactivity, and generative design—each one has something unique going on. 
Whether it's a visual piano that reacts to music, dynamic sand simulations, or ambient canvas animations, every sketch was a chance to try something new and expressive.

## 💻 How to Run These Projects

All you need is **Visual Studio Code** and the **Live Server extension**.

### Steps:
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the repo in **VS Code**.
3. Browse into any project folder (like `Piano_keys` or `Sound_Garden`).
4. Find the `.html` file (e.g., `piano.html`).
5. **Right-click the file** and choose **“Open with Live Server”**.
6. The sketch will launch in your default browser.

If you don’t have Live Server installed, you can install it from the **Extensions tab** in VS Code (`ritwickdey.LiveServer`).

Feel free to explore each project folder and tweak the code to make it your own.
